	Socket Programming is a way of connecting two nodes on a
Network to communicate with each other. One socket(node) listens on a
particular port at an IP, while other socket reaches out to the other
to form a connection. Server forms the listener socket while client 
reaches out to the server.


	The game begins when server and client are connected.
The client makes the first move and the corresponding move is sent over
the TCP network. Then the board gets updated accordingly at both ends.
Server and client make their moves alternatively until one of them wins
or the game ends in a draw..

	Instructions:

	1. First Execute the Server Program, then the Client
	2. Client has to make the first move
	3. X represents Client's moves and O represents Server's moves.
